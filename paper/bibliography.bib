 abstract = {Several old and new density estimators may have good theoretical performance, but are hampered by not being bona fide densities; they may be negative in certain regions or may not integrate to 1. One can therefore not simulate from them, for example. This paper develops general modification methods that turn any density estimator into one which is a bona fide density, and which is always better in performance under one set of conditions and arbitrarily close in performance under a complementary set of conditions. This improvement-for-free procedure can, in particular, be applied for higher-order kernel estimators, classes of modern $h^{4}$ bias kernel type estimators, superkernel estimators, the sinc kernel estimator, the k-NN estimator, orthogonal expansion estimators, and for various recently developed semi-parametric density estimators.},

abstract="In this paper we use an iterative algorithm for solving Fredholm equations of the first kind. The basic algorithm and convergence properties are known under certain conditions, but we provide a simpler convergence proof without requiring the restrictive conditions that have previously been needed. Several examples of independent interest are given, including mixing density estimation and a first passage time density function involving Brownian motion. We also develop the basic algorithm to include functions which are not necessarily non-negative and, again, present illustrations.",
